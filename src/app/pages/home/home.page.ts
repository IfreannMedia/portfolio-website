  public homeDescription: string = "Since my master’s graduation in 2019, I have worked as part of Akka technologies as a front end developer, working with a diverse ecosystem of technologies for a long-standing worldwide production-live Quality Control application. Professionally I work with the Angular – Ionic – Typescript stack, and implement Rxjs reactive programming. After focusing on this project for over a year and building my skills in a diverse team environment in one of the most beautiful cities of the world, I am now looking to broaden my horizon’s. Apart from my experience, what I intend to bring to the table is a passion for learning and improvement of code, and a patient and hard-working nature. I also care about bringing out the best performance from my teammates and striving towards an efficient work environment, as per the Tuckman group development model, for example. I believe there is something to be learned from everyone.";
